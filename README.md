##👋 About Me

I’m a B.Tech AIML student who believes in learning by building.
I enjoy creating meaningful projects, guiding and supporting others, and continuously improving my skills.
Curiosity drives me to explore technology, new ideas, and creative problem-solving.

Beyond tech, I have a deep interest in astrology, love traveling, and enjoy meeting new people to gain fresh perspectives.
